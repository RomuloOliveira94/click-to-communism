# 🚩 Click to Communism

*Seize the means of production, one click at a time!*

Welcome to the most revolutionary clicking experience on the internet! Join millions of comrades in the global movement to establish the ultimate communist utopia through the power of... clicking a button. Because that's definitely how revolutions work, right? 🤔

## What is this project?

Click to Communism is a simple yet powerful web application where users can contribute to the worldwide communist revolution by clicking a Soviet-themed button. Each click brings us one step closer to achieving true equality and collective ownership of... well, this click counter.

**Features:**

- 🖱️ Revolutionary click button with authentic Soviet imagery
- 🎵 Satisfying click sound effects (because revolution should sound good)
- 📊 Personal click tracking (your individual contribution to the cause)
- 🌍 Global counter (the collective power of the proletariat)
- 🔊 Audio feedback for maximum satisfaction
- 📱 Responsive design (revolution accessible on all devices)
- ✊ Revolutionary hands watermark (subtle propaganda)

## 🛠️ Technologies (The Tools of Revolution)

This application is built with the following technologies, carefully selected to serve the people:

- **SQLite** - Simple, reliable, and doesn't require enterprise licensing fees
- **Turbo Streams** - Real-time updates for instant revolutionary feedback
- **Stimulus** - Modest JavaScript framework for the modest revolutionary

### Frontend

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup for the semantic revolution
- **CSS3** - Styled with revolutionary red themes
- **JavaScript** - For interactive revolutionary experiences
- **Russo One Font** - Because Comic Sans is counter-revolutionary

### Infrastructure
